# Flipper POCSAG Receiver plugin

This this an hacked (and hacky) version that uses 466 MHz bands even on OFW and force hopping on 466 MHz bands.

The app informations & menus have not been updated, this is only a POC. Tested on OFW 0.87.0.

466MHz is not officially supported by the CC1101 chip and could result in hardware damage, use it your own risk.
